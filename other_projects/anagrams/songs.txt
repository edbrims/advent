OCC, please don't rewrite history, Victoria Wood had a No.1 with The Smile Song, a double A side with Hale and Pace in 1991. You credit Wet Wet Wet and Billy Bragg with a double A side in 1988, please respect Victorias memory and give her the same honour.

The first UK No 1 of 1974 should not state New Seekers.
The record label has The New Seekers Featuring Lyn Paul.
I have checked the official chart book and this is verified by it.

Why is Wham! Last Christmas dated 07th Jan 2021 ?????. It shouldnt even be week ending jan 7th. Its first day of sales was Christmas Day so surely it was no. 1 for the chart dated week ending 31st Dec 2020. Why is it a week ahead of what it really is. The fact is, it was calulated sales and stream up to midnight on 31st December, so surely thats the date, if it was announced on Jan 1st. The UK chart appears to be going all american and dating themselves a week or two in the future. As if we hadnt enough of controversy with downloads and streams, now the dates are been changed?

The 1953 "Song from Moulin Rouge" was #1 in the US for 10 weeks.
And the most popular song of the year.
In the UK it was #1 for only one week.

Would the British charts company please explain there Chart R/Entry rules.

I have always understood that a "R/E" was not counted as an official No 1 even thou it occupies the same spot!

Bruno Mars Uptown Funk made No1 on the Dec 20th 2014=1284th UK No1
Get https://lyricsnstatus.xyz/ for free.
Ben Haenow I Something I need made No1 Dec 27th=1285th

Bruno Mars Re-enters the chart on 3rd Jan but Does not get 1286th No1 because it's classed as a R/E

The 1286th UK No1 goes to Ellie Gouldings Love me like you do on the 14th Feb 2015=1286th UK No1 thus chronologically is the First UK No1 of 2015.

Who's come across the ... "Every Official UK Number 1 Ever" playlist on Spotify?
Sorry Official Charts People but your list is nowhere near complete--and I don't mean up-to-date The omission of double A-sided hits (plenty of those down the years) and tracks listed equally on EPs makes this a less-than-complete list.
For instance, how can you leave off "Eleanor Rigby" or "We Can Work It Out". As for some artists, they're not even in the list! Picking out one...I realise Demis Roussos isn't every one's pop idol, but he made the top of the UK charts with a four-track EP. Your list doesn't even have the most popular of those four tracks, "Forever and Ever". Or how about the excellent "Guns of Navarone" track from The Specials A.K.A. Live EP?
The list is a great idea... just finish it off and make it a COMPLETE list. Oh, and in chronological order too would be very nice, then we can truly enjoy ALL the UK Number i hits EVER.

Can you please credit the late Victoria Wood with a No.1 single? 'The Smile Song' was a double A side with Hale and Pace, but gets no recognition. If it's good enough to credit Billy Bragg with Wet Wet Wet, then it's good enough for Victoria.

Just curious but here in the US on the Billboard Hot 100 Chart, if an artist is listed on a track as a featured artist then that artist is credited with a Number 1 single to their career. Is that same chart methodology true for the Official Charts and if so who has the most Official Chart Number 1 Singles with combined Lead & Featured Artist credits?

Justin Bieber's "What Do You Mean?" went to the top of the Official UK Chart 3 times in the same year spending a total of 5 non-consecutive weeks there. Are there any other songs that pulled off such a feat in the UK Charts?

This is a great, quick way of seeing how much attention I paid to the charts over the years. From 1975-1985 I know every single. Prior to that it was gradually increasing. Since 1986 it's been really up and down depending on my lifestyle. Funny thing about 2014, I listened/watched avidly but don't remember names of artists or singles. Oh well.😥

Hi Nick, Turn The Music Louder (Rumble) was a number 1 on the 23/10/15 when you wrote your comment and Adele was a number 1 with Hello a week later on the 30/10/15. The Official Charts Company are correct but not with this website.

Now we have a similar situation with mister Biebers What do you Mean gets the No1 slot on 10th Sept=1301st UK No1
Sigalas Easy Love on 17th Sept=1302nd UK No1
Bieber R/E the chart on Sept 24th as a R/entry

Now who is going to be the 1303rd UK No1 this coming friday, but one thing is for sure it won't be Justin Biebers What do you mean!

Absolute nonsense. If Ellie Goulding wasn't number one on the first chart of 2015, then it isn't the first number one of the year. It's that simple. It makes no difference whether something was a re-entry, moved back up to number one, or anything else, it's a simple matter of understanding the English language. The first number one of 2015 is the track at number one in the first chart of 2015, although you could make out an argument that Ben Haenow holds that honour as he was at the top in the chart valid on 1 January 2015.

whenever a single gets to number one it will always be a re visit to number one if it gets there on a separate occasion and therefor does not ever count as a new number one unless released as a remix or re-recording

The run goes back until October 2013 - from then until December 2015, only seven songs spent more than one consecutive week at number one, and there have been six already in the first five months of 2015.

In 2014, there were only nine songs to spend multiple weeks at number 1 too - Happy, Rather Be, Waves, Ghost, Am I Wrong, Prayer in C (?), All About That Bass, Thinking Out Loud and Uptown Funk. Maybe because loads of songs in 2014 hit high but didn't spend long at all in the top 40.

As of 17th May, there have been seven different number ones. By this time last year, there had already been fourteen different number ones, including Happy, which was number one on three different occasions. Such a change in such a short time. Could the streaming be affecting the top of the charts that much?

Yeah I agree, I think it's because of streaming. Otherwise there's no way songs like Want to Want Me would be number 1 for a month but others like La La La by Naughty Boy were only 1 week.
